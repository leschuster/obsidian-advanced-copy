In markdown, you can emphasize text in various ways to convey different meanings or highlight important information. Below are some examples of how to use emphasis in markdown:

## Emphasis

_Italic text_ can be used to emphasize a word or phrase subtly. For example, you might use italics to highlight a key term or concept within a sentence.

**Bold text** is used for stronger emphasis. It can be helpful for drawing attention to important points or headings.

**_Bold and italic text_** combines both styles for even greater emphasis. This can be useful for highlighting very important information or for stylistic purposes.

~~Strikethrough~~ is used to indicate that something is no longer relevant or has been deleted. This can be useful for showing edits or changes in a document.

Using these different forms of emphasis can help make your markdown documents more readable and engaging.

## Lists

### Unordered List

-   Item 1
    -   Subitem 1
    -   Subitem 2
-   Item 2

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
    1. Subitem 1
        1. Subitem 1.1
        2. Subitem 1.2
        3. Subitem 1.3
    2. Subitem 2

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.

> This is another blockquote.
> But with multiple lines.
> > And another blockquote embedded inside it
> > with multiple lines.

## Code

### Inline Code

Here is some `inline code`.

### Code Block

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

This is a code block without a specified language:

```
hello world
```

## Callouts

> [!info] Simple

> [!warning]- _WARNING_
> This callout is more complex.
> > [!danger] Because
> > there is another callout embedded inside it.

## Math

Below is an example of block math:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

Another block math example:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)
$$

Inline math within a sentence: The quadratic formula is given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

And a block math right after:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] is a comedic science fiction series created by [[Douglas Adams|Douglas Adams]]. It began as a radio broadcast in 1978 and has since expanded into various formats, including novels, television series, and a feature film. The story follows the adventures of [[Arthur Dent|Arthur Dent]], an ordinary human who is unwittingly swept off Earth just before it is destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur's journey through the galaxy introduces him to a host of eccentric characters, including [[Ford Prefect|Ford Prefect]], a researcher for the titular guidebook; [[Zaphod Beeblebrox|Zaphod Beeblebrox]], the two-headed, three-armed ex-President of the Galaxy; and [[Marvin|Marvin]], the perpetually depressed robot.

Central to the series is the eponymous guidebook, [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]], a digital encyclopedia that provides humorous and often wildly inaccurate information about the universe. The guidebook's entries are a source of much of the series' humor, offering absurd advice and observations on everything from interstellar travel to the best way to make a cup of tea in zero gravity. The phrase "Don't Panic," emblazoned on the guidebook's cover, has become an iconic piece of pop culture wisdom.

The series is renowned for its wit, satire, and philosophical musings. Adams uses the absurdity of the galaxy to explore themes such as the meaning of life, the nature of reality, and the absurdity of bureaucracy. One of the most famous elements of the series is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything: the number 42. This seemingly arbitrary answer has sparked endless debate and analysis among fans and scholars alike.

[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|The guide]] has left a lasting legacy in the world of science fiction and comedy. Its unique blend of humor and philosophical insight has influenced countless writers and creators. The series continues to be beloved by fans around the world, who find solace and laughter in its pages, and who, like [[Arthur Dent|Arthur Dent]], learn to navigate the chaos of the universe with a sense of humor and a towel always at hand.
