<p>In markdown, you can emphasize text in various ways to convey different meanings or highlight important information. Below are some examples of how to use emphasis in markdown:</p>

<h2>Emphasis</h2>

<p><em>Italic text</em> can be used to emphasize a word or phrase subtly. For example, you might use italics to highlight a key term or concept within a sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Bold text</strong> is used for stronger emphasis. It can be helpful for drawing attention to important points or headings.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bold and italic text</em></strong> combines both styles for even greater emphasis. This can be useful for highlighting very important information or for stylistic purposes.</p>

<p><del>Strikethrough</del> is used to indicate that something is no longer relevant or has been deleted. This can be useful for showing edits or changes in a document.</p>

<p>Using these different forms of emphasis can help make your markdown documents more readable and engaging.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<li>Item 2</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ordered List</h3>

<h2>Blockquotes</h2>

<blockquote>
This is a blockquote.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This is another blockquote.But with multiple lines.<blockquote>And another blockquote embedded inside itwith multiple lines.</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Code</h2>

<h3>Inline Code</h3>

<p>Here is some <code>inline code</code>.</p>

<h3>Code Block</h3>

<pre><code>def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")</code></pre>

<p>This is a code block without a specified language:</p>

<pre><code>hello world</code></pre>

<h2>Callouts</h2>

<div class="callout callout-info callout-closeable-false callout-default-open-true">
<h2>Simple</h2>
<div></div>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-warning callout-closeable-true callout-default-open-false">
<h2><em>WARNING</em></h2>
<div>This callout is more complex.<div class="callout callout-danger callout-closeable-false callout-default-open-true"><h2>Because</h2><div>there is another callout embedded inside it.</div></div></div>
</div>

<h2>Math</h2>

<p>Below is an example of block math:</p>

\[\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\]

<p>Another block math example:</p>

\[\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)\]

<p>Inline math within a sentence: The quadratic formula is given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).</p>

<p>And a block math right after:</p>

\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]
